# Quiz App-   [Trivial](https://m-fidow.github.io/Trivial/)

## About

As a team of 4, we built a quiz app applying the skills we learnt from HTML to JavaScript. The user can select different quiz categories and the difficulty of the questions. The game fetches questions from the Trivia API and awards points for the correct answers as the user progresses. Depending on the score, the player gets a funny gif as a reward.
